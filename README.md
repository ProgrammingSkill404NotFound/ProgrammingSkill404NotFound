Hi, as my name suggests, I don't have any programing Skill (Or atleast I think I don't) I am learning on my own as dumb as that is, the only reason I'm here is to use repositories, if you somehow stumbled upon me then I think you are looking at the wrong person, happy coding, and don't let the code bugs bite! Hopefully...
